#### Description:

**Beat the Billionaire** is an innovative Flask-based web game designed to challenge and improve a player’s memory, focus, and decision-making speed in a fun and competitive environment. By combining strategy, observation, and time management, the game offers a unique cognitive workout while keeping players entertained. Its simple yet engaging mechanics make it accessible to gamers of all skill levels, from casual players to those seeking a more intense mental challenge.

The game revolves around a central objective: selecting the highest-value combination of cards to beat a billionaire’s net worth. Each card represents a different financial role or asset, each with a hidden monetary value. At the beginning of each round, players enter a **preview phase** lasting 40 seconds. During this phase, a grid of cards is displayed face-up, allowing players to carefully study and memorize the values of individual cards. Attention to detail and quick observation are essential, as these skills directly impact success in the game.

Once the preview phase concludes, all cards flip back to their concealed state, and the **selection phase** begins. Players are allowed to select **exactly five cards**. The challenge lies in recalling the positions and values of the cards, then choosing a combination whose total value can outmatch the billionaire’s pre-determined net worth. Each decision is crucial: selecting the wrong cards could mean falling short, while careful choices can secure victory. The game requires both memory skills and strategic thinking under pressure.
